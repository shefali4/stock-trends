# Python/MATLAB Stock Trends Application

I used MATLAB and Python to track the trends between the Coke and Pepsi Stocks over a period of several decades.

I parsed through the Yahoo Stocks data file, developed and read from a CSV file, and plotted a scatter plot and inserted a trendline for better stock predictions.

This application can be used to identify trends for any chosen two stocks!
